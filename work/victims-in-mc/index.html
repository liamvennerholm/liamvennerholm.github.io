                <p>Late in his career, John Hejduk had a radical idea for a way architecture could be practiced differently. It was a project he called “the Social Contract” which he describes like this:</p>

                    <blockquote>What I did was build a repertoire of 400 pieces, or 400 characters. I had done that over 15 years. And now what’s happening is that in different places throughout the world they are building each of these characters, so there’s basically no client— fundamentally. They draw it up. They detail it. They’re a part of the creation of the thing and then they put it out into the public domain, and it becomes some kind of strange celebration of the art of building, the art of structure, the sociopolitical aspect of architecture.</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>I have only one requirement … all I require is that the spirit is captured.</blockquote>

                <p>I see this Minecraft world as, aside from a small nerdy project, a sort of contribution to this “Social Contract.”  Similar to the act of adapting a book into a movie, making the necessary changes in accordance with the new medium, I’ve had to adapt these structures to the logic of Minecraft, but I believe I’ve captured their “spirit.”</p>

                <p>I hope you enjoy this recreation of a project I greatly admire.</p>
