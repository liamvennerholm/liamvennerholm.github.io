The field, which has an opening of the same size and shape in the roof above it, is rotated 45 degrees relative to the overall square shape of the stadium. This results in large openings along the exterior perimeter where mountains can be seen between the mountains of fans."></a>

It is an open space with galvanized steel columns in a grid. Populating the space are various people: One on an upper level that is open to below, and others interacting with large blue and green stained concrete benches and low walls on the first level. There are two large concrete shapes int the background, which are the entrances to the restrooms. The walls of the restrooms, ceiling of the whole space, and the exterior walls beyond are all painted red."></a>

The triangle of stands on the is filled with a pattern of blue and gold rhombuses. The triangle of stands on the right is filled with a pattern of red and gray vertical stripes. On the bottom is a section of the stadium cutting through a diagonal of the diamond shape of the whole building. The stands slope down from the outsides toward the feild in the center. The stands on the far end of the stadium can be seen in the background."></a>

Inside this square area connected by they're centers is empty, cutting out the corners of the square from the circles. If the circles did not exist the square would not be seen. This diagram is commonly used to illustrate the gestalt principle of closure.">

                <p>The gestalt principle of closure is often illustrated with the diagram on the left. When presented with this image, the human brain sees a square that isn’t there. The brain needs little context to understand a whole. The parti for this soccer stadium (on the right) illustrates a similar idea, but rather than revealing a square from the outside corners in, it is revealed from the inside out.</p>

                <p>The stadium’s exterior walls align with the regulating lines of it’s site, the Milan Innovation District, while the soccer field aligns with FIFA’s solar orientation guidelines creating a misalignment of interior and exterior. The main bowl of the stands is cut off at the corners creating large pyramids of fans reminiscent of the Alps which can be seen from Milan. The slope of the stands is transferred to the facade, creating a downward arrow pointing to entrances at the corners of the field.</p>

                <p>The stadium aspires to formal simplicity informed by its context and is decorated with the colors and patterns of the fans who claim it.</p>
