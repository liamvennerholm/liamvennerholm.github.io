                <figcaption>Photos of the bollards I took while in Italy (1-7), drawings of family of street furniture (8-10), elevations of bollard appendages (11-12).</figcaption>
                <p>As a part of a team for a larger masterplan project, I was tasked with designing the street furniture and wayfinding. I had recently just gotten back from my study abroad to Italy where masses of <a href="/blog/panettone/beginning.html">gregarious bollards</a> had become a bit of an obsession for me. I saw their creaturely behaviour and features, and I knew I had to do something with them in this project.</p>
                <p>Their design, simultaneously cute and utilitarian, inspired the design for a whole family of different pieces of street furniture for <a href="https://www.comune.faraolivanaconsola.bg.it/">two towns in rural Italy</a>.</p>
                <p>The smaller members of this street furniture family can be placed all over the towns, and can be used by any resident for any purpose. One of the things I loved about the bollards I saw when I was there was the amount of different specialized appendages they had for different jobs. It only made sense to build on this with things like bike racks and clotheslines and anything else the residents of these towns can think of.</p>
                <p>The larger members of the family are idiosyncratic creatures that respond to town landmarks: two churches, an elementary school, and a cemetery. An outdoor pulpit and a confessional are for the churches; a playground is built for the elementary school; and for the cemetery that connects the two towns, there is a pavilion resembling an ossuary.</p>
