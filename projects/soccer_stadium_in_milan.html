                    <img src="images/soccer_stadium_in_milan/gestalt_diagram.png" alt="Four filled circles are placed so that if lines were drawn connecting their centers, there would be a perfect square. Inside this square area connected by they're centers is empty, cutting out the corners of the square from the circles. If the circles did not exist the square would not be seen. This diagram is commonly used to illustrate the gestalt principle of closure." class="project-icon">
                    <img src="images/soccer_stadium_in_milan/parti_diagram.png" alt="A filled square is rotated 45 degrees. Inside the square is a vertically oriented rectangular hole taller than wide with its corners meeting perfectly at the edges of the square." class="project-icon">

                <p>The gestalt principle of closure is often illustrated with the diagram on the left. When presented with this image, the human brain sees a square that isn’t there. The brain needs little context to understand a whole. The parti for this soccer stadium (on the right) illustrates a similar idea, but rather than revealing a square from the outside corners in, it is revealed from the inside out.</p>
                <p>The stadium consists of stands that are arranged parallel to the edges of the soccer field with the corners cut off at an angle. The resulting building has exterior walls that are misaligned with the interior. While the exterior walls of the stadium align to the regulating lines of the Milan Innovation District, the soccer field adheres to FIFA’s guidelines for solar orientation resulting in a conversation between the two that becomes evident when one is sitting in the stands, walking through the main concourse, or viewing the stadium from afar.</p>
                <p>Aesthetically, the stadium draws on the formal ideas of Aldo Rossi and the playful and graphic explorations of Ettore Sottsass Jr. It’s a big, dumb box with a colorful skin and confetti benches, walls, and floor graphics dancing all around. It’s not focused on being a vision of the stadium of tomorrow, but rather it is a stadium where people can enjoy themselves and their favorite sport.</p>
