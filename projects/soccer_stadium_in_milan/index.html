                    <img src="images/gestalt_diagram.png" alt="Four filled circles are placed so that if lines were drawn connecting their centers, there would be a perfect square. Inside this square area connected by they're centers is empty, cutting out the corners of the square from the circles. If the circles did not exist the square would not be seen. This diagram is commonly used to illustrate the gestalt principle of closure." class="project-icon">
                    <img src="images/parti_diagram.png" alt="A filled square is rotated 45 degrees. Inside the square is a vertically oriented rectangular hole taller than wide with its corners meeting perfectly at the edges of the square." class="project-icon">
                </div>
                <p>The gestalt principle of closure is often illustrated with the diagram on the left. When presented with this image, the human brain sees a square that isn’t there. The brain needs little context to understand a whole. The parti for this soccer stadium (on the right) illustrates a similar idea, but rather than revealing a square from the outside corners in, it is revealed from the inside out.</p>

                <p>The stadium’s exterior walls align with the regulating lines of it’s site, the Milan Innovation District, while the soccer field aligns with FIFA’s solar orientation guidelines creating a misalignment of interior and exterior. The main bowl of the stands is cut off at the corners creating large pyramids of fans reminiscent of the Alps which can be seen from Milan. The slope of the stands is transferred to the facade, creating a downward arrow pointing to entrances at the corners of the field.</p>

                <p>The stadium aspires to formal simplicity informed by its context and is decorated with the colors and patterns of the fans who claim it.</p>

                <p>The design draws on the formal ideas of Aldo Rossi and John Hejduk and the playful and graphic explorations of Ettore Sottsass Jr. It is an aspiration for formal simplicity, a big dumb box, while still keeping the focus on what everyone’s here for … soccer.</p>
