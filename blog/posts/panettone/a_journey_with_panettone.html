            <article>
                <p><span aria-hidden="true"><span class="dropcap">B</span>efore</span>

                <span class="sr-only">Before</span> studying abroad in Italy, traffic bollards never captured my attention. I only noticed them as rather mundane markers distiguishing human space from car space at the entrances of various grocery stores … then my study abroad to Italy introuced me to multitudes of knee-height, gumdrop-shaped, concrete bollard companions.</p>
                <p>Sometimes gathered in herds, other times all by their lonesome, these stoic creatures have a visual mobility to them that contradicts the immense weight of their concrete construction. It seems like they’re living their little bollard lives, but then as you turn around and look at them, they freeze in place. 
                <p>They have shared physical characteristics—such as their domed profile—but they’re also quite genetically diverse. You’ll commonly find them sporting a yellow paint job, but they also sometimes appear in shades of blue, green, various washes of red, and countless other colors—you might even find them wearing stripes.</p>
                <p>Another notable difference is the job that the bollard is doing. That is, what are they doing with the appendage they have, if any, that protrudes from the top of their dome. Lots of the time you’ll find them holding up street signs or stanchions with chains or ropes joining a herd of them.</p>
                <p>After getting back from Italy, this bollard obsession continued and found its way in to a couple of my studio projects. I tried to learn more, but searching the internet “yellow, gumdrop-shaped bollard” doesn’t really turn up with many helpful search results. I didn’t know the name of the bollards or the name of the person who designed them. I assumed that they were an anonymous object that was designed by someone whose name I’d never know.</p>
                <p>But then a friend sent me a photo of a book cover she’d seen in an art museum’s bookstore. It was the cover for The Paradox of Stillness: Art, Object, and Performance which depicts five dome-shaped friends sitting on a concrete floor each painted a different color. I had never seen these bollards before, so I looked up the book to learn more … and learn more I did.</p>
                <p>These book cover bollards aren’t our beloved Milanese companions; they’re a series of small mobile sculptures made by the artist Robert Breer. Concealed inside their brightly colored domes are mechanisms that move them very slowly across the floor of an art gallery; Breer called them floats.</p> 
                <p>While learning about Breer’s floats, I found familiar image of a small concrete bollard on a street in Milan. This image led me to an article about Italian designer Giulio Iacchetti. The image in question was not of of the bollard I hoped to learn about but of a work by Iacchetti paying homage to the same bollard. It turns out I am not the only one with an affinity for these guys. But alas, just as I realized this, I see the long-awaited name of the father of these bollards … Enzo Mari? It was Enzo Mari the whole time? Yes. It was Enzo Mari the whole time.</p>
                <p>In 1980, Milan needed a quick and simple solution for traffic issues they were having. They called up Milanese designer Enzo Mari to help. Mari developed a bollard that he named Panettone. Their shape is in reference to their namesake: panettone. Traditionally eaten at Christmas time, the panettone cake is an icon of Milan with its domed cylinder shape. Mari’s Panettone is a simple concrete shape that does the jobs of bollard, traffic cone, signage stand, and impromptu bench for weary pedestrians. Unlike the cake, the bollards weigh around 200kg (~440lbs) each, putting a big asterisk on their ability to be moved easily; that is, they can really only be moved with the aid of equipment or perhaps someone of excedingly above-average strength. They were originally intended as a short-term solution, but they ended up sticking around after being released onto the streets of Milan; like their love for the Christmas cake, the Milanese grew quite fond of these concrete friends. </p>
                <p>Upon a closer look, some Panettoni have canted sides while others’ sides are vertical. Perhaps some Panettoni suffer from a slouching problem, but I think it’s more than that. Those with canted sides also tend to have newer, more vibrant paint jobs compared to the weathered, dull ones of the bollards with perfectly vertical sides. My best guess is that the older generation of bollards—that is the more weathered ones—don’t have canted sides, but as soon as Milan decided they were here to stay, they had to mass-produce them thus changing the design slightly in favor of a shape that demolds from its formwork more easily, so the form can be reused.</p>
                <p>These Panettoni found their way into the hearts of the Milanese which continues to the present. Giulio Iacchetti, the Italian industrial designer I mentioned earlier, has paid homage to Mari’s icon in a couple of his designs. In 2014, he designed Bard, a plush piece of furniture that owes its image to the Panettone. It is the same size and shape as Mari’s, only this time it’s plush. Iacchetti also designed a Panettone paperweight called Medhelan in September 2021.</p>
                <p>Claud Everett, another designer in Milan, runs an Instagram page called @maripanettone, an archive of Panettoni and Panettone-shaped objects. Additionally, in 2014, Everett catalogued an interesting encounter with a Panettone or Mari, as he calls them. On a walking trail in Northern Italy, he found a lone Mari where there should be two according to all the other entrances to that path. He shortly found that the other had fallen into a nearby river. He constructed a Snow Mari to fill the void next to the lonely one, and then came back daily to document its condition. It only lasted 3 days before it melted.</p>
                <p>The Italian street artist Pao (@paopao_island on Instagram) uses Panettoni as the canvas for his art. He paints them to look like different characters from pop culture, though usually they’re penguins. My favorite one he’s painted looks like R2-D2.</p>
                <p>Overall, I’m very grateful to have met these Panettoni and see the world through their eyes. They exist at the core of a messy, but effective ecosystem of street furniture, and they’re maybe the most Italian object I’ve ever encountered.</p>
