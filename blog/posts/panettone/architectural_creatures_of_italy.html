                <span class="sr-only">An</span> idea in design that I am rather interested in is the idea of the designed objects around us being active participants in our lives—creatures that live alongside us—not merely a part of the backdrop on which we live our lives. This view of design as a living thing is easy to see when an object resembles a form of biotic life (e.g., a building that looks like a duck), but using zoomorphic forms is not the only way of giving life to the things we design. One other way is to make them behave like living creatures; maybe there is a suggestion movement or emotion. I witnessed an example of this in Italy.</p>
                <p>Of all things that could seem to have some life to them, traffic bollards were not something I had given too much though to. However, in Italy I kept noticing these large, concrete, gumdrop-shaped forms all over the place. Sometimes they were all on their own, and sometimes they were gathered in herds; some of them were painted, some were left bare; some held street signs, some did not seem to have any job to fulfill. Unlike the bollards you might see in the United States that are usually affixed to the ground and in neat, orderly lines, these ones in Italy are able to be moved around like traffic cones; they are never in a perfectly ordered arrangement. It’s as if they live a life of their own behind our backs, but as soon as we turn to look at them, they freeze in place.</p>
                <p>I am not the only one who sees life in these bollards. In fact, I saw one that someone had painted to look like a penguin. The act of painting this object to look like an animal, in conjunction with the idea that it seems to behave like an animal, makes it plain to see just how lively these objects are. If an object as simple as a concrete bollard can have so much life to it, I wonder how lively everything else can be.</p>
