            <small><em>11/26/2023</em></small>
            <small><em>This is a piece that has been adapted into a blog post. It originally appeared in an exibition I put together with Paolo Sanza in my final year in undergrad.</em></small>
            <article>
                <p><span aria-hidden="true"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span>

                <span class="sr-only">As</span> a part of this now two and a half year self-guided Panettone study, I’ve 3D printed numerous small-scale Panettoni. I made all of these small Panettoni—you could call them “Panettoncini”, Italian for “small Panettoni”—to study the impact of the scale on the versatility of actions that the Panettone perform.</p>
                    <p>The smallest Panettoncini (Ø 1cm to 2.5cm) are at a scale that might be able to be used as a game piece for a board game. Then there is the medium scale (Ø 5cm). This is the scale of a desk ornament. As such, they use their 3mm holes for bent paperclip appendages that hold my pens, USB flashdrives, and binder clips. I also have one at my house that holds incense sticks. The next scale (Ø 10cm) is the largest … so far. At this scale the Panettoncino is able to hold a pen in its top hole, though recently I’ve put a broken dowel rod in there.</p>
                    <p>At each scale Panettone can perform different actions and lends itself to different contexts—the gameboard, the desk, the dining room table, etc.—but what can it do at full scale? </p>
                    <p>Can Panettone exist in an ecosystem of home furniture rather than street furniture? Can Panettone be domesticated?</p>
                    <p>This estrangement of context by bringing Panettone into the home leads to issues. Panettone doesn’t want to exist in the home as it does on the street. And of course it resists; it’s over 400 pounds of concrete! But, as with the dog compared to the wolf, perhaps there are domestic breeds of Panettone that can more easily exist in the home than on the streets of Milan.</p>
                    <p>Maybe Panettone can be a piece of flat-pack furniture: two Panettone-shaped pieces of plywood that have vertical slots cut in their centers so that they can lap-joint together crossing in plan—a skeleton of Panettone. Or maybe a domestic Panettone can be 3D printed. Rather than the rugged, dimpled concrete of the wild Panettone, this breed has smooth layer lines.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps a domestic Panettone is a pillow. This calls to mind Giulio Iaccetti’s plush Panettone, Bard. But Bard charmingly mimics the concrete texture of the wild Panettone with an image of concrete printed on its fabric. But what if Panettone embraced the aesthetic of a pillow with stitched panels and a button on top?</p>
                    <p>The domesticated Panettone might also have different appendages like tables and chairs, coat racks, clothing racks, lamps, and oscilating fans.</p>
                    <p>Thinking about the adaptations necessary to domesticate Panettone leads me to try and think about other contexts it can inhabit. What’s an office Panettone? What’s a gym Panettone? What’s a Panettone for dogs? What is a an Oklahoman Panettone? Each of these habitats have different conditions that can have different effects on the appearance, behavior, and perception of Panettone. Now, to figure out which one I’ll choose first … I guess I’ll have to see where Panettone leads me.</p>
