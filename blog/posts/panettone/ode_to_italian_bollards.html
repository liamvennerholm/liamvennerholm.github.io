                <span class="sr-only">Traffic</span> bollards have never occupied much real estate in my brain. Why would they? Their only purpose is to solve vehicular traffic issues. During my study abroad in Italy last summer, I received an answer to that question in the form of multitudes of knee-height, gumdrop-shaped, concrete companions.</p>
                <p>Sometimes gathered in herds, other times all alone, these stoic creatures have a certain visual mobility to them that contradicts the immense weight of their concrete construction. It seems as if they’re living their little bollard lives, but then as you turn around and look at them, they freeze in place.</p>
                <p>Like the creatures of the animal kingdom, they have shared physical characteristics, such as canted sides and an overall domed profile, but they also exhibit a certain amount of genetic diversity. Most of the time, if they’re not left as bare concrete, you’ll find them sporting a yellow coloration; on rare occasions you might find a red one. Another variation is whether or not they have holes in their tops. These holes, when present, can provide a bollard with a versatility that it wouldn’t have otherwise. With these holes, the bollard can interact with any number of standardized cylindrical attachments, though usually they’re street signs.</p>
                <p>Whether their design is intentionally playful or merely just a utilitarian concrete shape designed to easily demold from its formwork, it lends itself to creaturely ideas while also being a blank canvas. In fact, I’m not the only one who sees this; someone else took it upon themselves to make this creaturely demeanor more explicit by painting one of those bollards to look like a penguin.</p>
                <p>One might think I’m a bit too infatuated with these awkward little concrete domes, especially since they are surrounded by eons of architectural history in Italy, but I really do think it’s valuable to notice the anonymous, taken-for-granted objects in our everyday lives. In other words … it’s the little things.</p>
