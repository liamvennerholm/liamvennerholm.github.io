				<![CDATA[<p>Hello! I’m Liam, and this is my website. What is the purpose of this website? Well, I’m glad you asked. In short, I’m making this website as a place to put all of my stuff. What stuff? Again, thank you for asking. I’ll be filling this website with <a href="https://liamvennerholm.github.io/blog/favorites.html">lists of my favorite things</a>, <a href="https://liamvennerholm.github.io/blog/sketchbook.html">different ideas I’m obsessively sketching</a>, <a href="https://liamvennerholm.github.io/blog/camera.html">pictures I take</a>, and really anything else I can think of.</p>
				<p>I kind of want this to be where post stuff instead of my social media pages. Social media platforms seem to be going to shit recently, and I also don’t tend to like how they make me feel when I’m on them for extended periods of time. Here, I can make what I want without worrying about likes or ads or the fact that my content exists on a platform that is liable to crumble under the weight of the maniacal CEO in charge.</p>
				<p>So grab your favorite <a href="https://liamvennerholm.github.io/feed.xml">RSS</a> reader and come along while I figure this out :)</p>]]>
